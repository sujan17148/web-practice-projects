# 🌐 Web Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini frontend projects built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. These were created while learning and experimenting with core web development concepts — everything from simple UIs to interactive games and apps.

Most of these are **standalone apps** that showcase different frontend skills: DOM manipulation, local storage, event handling, async APIs, and more.
